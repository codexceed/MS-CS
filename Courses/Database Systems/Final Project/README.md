# Database Systems Final Project
## Use Case: Grople Syrup Production
We have been given the monthly production quantity for a certain agricultural 
product (letâ€™s call it Grople syrup, note - no relation to actual Maple Syrup) 
in 10 different provinces of a country between January 2015 to December 2020. 
This Grople syrup comes from a fruit. It takes a few months for the fruits to 
grow on the trees which bear them. It also takes a few days to extract the syrup 
from the fruits after they have been harvested.

## Setup
- Ensure Python 3.8 or higher is installed
